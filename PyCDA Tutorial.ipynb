    "## PyCDA Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is intended to help non-coders make crater detections using PyCDA. By following the steps in this tutorial, you can make crater detections on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Python and Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to Python altogether, the fastest way to get started (and the approach weâ€™ll take in this tutorial) is by installing Conda on your computer.\n",
    "The recommended version of conda for this tutorial is Anaconda. Anaconda comes with python and a lot of extra features. Go to [this page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), select your operating system, and download the Python 3.6 version. Follow the steps to install Anaconda on your system; for additional help with getting up and running with Anaconda, check out [this great tutorial for installing Anaconda on Windows](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-windows-anaconda-c63c7c3d1444) or [this tutorial for installing Anaconda on MacOS](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-mac-anaconda-ccd9f2014072).\n",

    "### Building your Crater Detection Environment\n",
    "Although not strictly necessary, I highly recommend creating a dedicated conda environment to install pycda. Open your Anaconda prompt and type:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name craters python=3.6`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an environment on your system called \"craters.\" Next, activate your \"craters\" environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "`source activate craters` (MacOS and Linux)<br>\n",
    "`activate craters` (Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your environment is activated, install pycda with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install pycda`\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip will take care of the rest for you. Once it's downloaded and installed, you're ready to go! You can test your installation with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python\n",
    "Python 3.6.5 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Apr 29 2018, 16:14:56) \n",
    "[GCC 7.2.0] on linux\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> import pycda\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this works, you've successfuly install PyCDA!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Up a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a python application that allows you to execute python code and visualize results in very easy-to-use interface. Best of all, it comes with Anaconda, so in the above installation process, you should have installed Jupyter as well! Open a notebook by going to your Anaconda prompt and typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`jupyter notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see some output in the console; if you've never run a notebook before, you may need to copy and paste the link that appears. Otherwise, it should automatically open a tab in your browser. From the Jupyter menu, click on the tab on the upper-right corner called \"new\" and select \"Python 3\" from the drop-down menu. This will open up a new notebook.\n",
